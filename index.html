            <p>Bear in mind that our criteria for this list narrowed the pool down to focus on “modern” PC games, which means it only covers games released or majorly updated during the past 10 years – in this case, back to the beginning of 2013. We still love games like the original Doom, Half-Life 2, Portal, Skyrim, StarCraft 2, Mass Effect 2, Minecraft, BioShock, KOTOR, Fallout: New Vegas, Batman: Arkham City, and many, many more, but they’ve graduated from modern to all-time classics. To find those you’ll need to check out our list of the Top 100 Games of All Time – or our other lists that strive to capture the best of a given genre.
                Most importantly, remember that this list is just our group’s perspective and is no more “right” or “wrong” than a list that you create yourself. Speaking of which: if you have your own ranking you’d like to put out into the world, we’d like to invite you to make your own top 25 (or top 100!) list of PC games using our Playlist tool and share it in the comments Most recent game updates were made on March 21 You Might Also like Top 100 Video Games Best Horror Games for PC</p>

        <h1>25. Hollow Knight</h1>
        <div>
        <img src="hollow-knight-1711035889349.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Hollow Knight is one of the best modern Metroidvania’s around. It’s beautiful, expansive, and full of delightful secrets to discover that can keep you playing for dozens of hours. The kingdom of Hallownest is a brutal one, and Hollow Knight doesn’t ease you into it. That may have caused a lot of people to bounce off of it initially – but when it finally gets its hooks in you it’s irresistibly hard to put down.
            Sprawling caves open up and offer multiple paths to you at any given time, but no matter which way you go there are exciting bosses to fight and significant power-ups to make you stronger. And even though it was already a massive game, Hollow Knight has only gotten bigger since its launch in early 2017. Developer Team Cherry released multiple free updates with new areas and bosses, each harder than the last. But whether you just want to get to the credits, find the true ending, or push even farther than that, Hallownest is a world worth exploring.
            The sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, was supposed to be released in the first half of 2023, but Team Cherry delayed it further due to ongoing development. Will 2024 be the year we finally get more Hollow Knight? Check out our Hollow Knight review.</p>

        <p>For many younger fans, From Software may be known primarily for its work with the Souls series. But for the elders, the studio won over hearts and minds with the sci-fi mecha action of Armored Core. Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon manages to take the tried-and-true fundamentals of the classic series and combine them with the learnings and experience gained over the years of developing the Souls series.
            The result is an action-packed, at times brutally difficult, but also carefully calculated action game that rewards smart preparation as much as it does your twitch reflex skills, with some of the most outstanding boss encounters we’ve seen in a long time.Check out our Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon review.</p>

        <p>Not since the Batman: Arkham series has a game so effectively distilled the power fantasy of a fan-favorite superhero and injected it so expertly into our eyeballs. Spider-Man Remastered may be native to the PlayStation 5, but on a high-end PC you can push it even farther than what a console can muster and experience swinging around in the open world of New York City, plus Spidey’s free-flowing combat and a fantastic story, all with the ray tracing wizardry pushed to the limit.

        <p>Standing tall as one of the strongest single-player shooters in recent memory, Machine Games’ Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus turned the rebooted Nazi-killing rampage series into a character-driven story that gave BJ Blaskowitz not only a wonderfully satisfying arsenal of alternate-history weaponry, but added new dimension to him as a person and introduced a fantastically evil villain in the gleefully sadistic General Engel. This cautionary tale of fascism conquering America has only become more relevant in the time since it came out in 2017.</p>

    <h1>21. Final Fantasy XIV</h1>

            <img src="final-fantasy-14-1612576526427-1636169496184-1711035889347.png" alt="">
            <p>In short, Final Fantasy XIV is not just the best MMO you can play right now, it’s a fantastic Final Fantasy game in its own right. Through its relaunch and subsequent four expansions, FFXIV has slowly morphed from a relatively generic good-versus-evil plot into a sprawling, political, and fantastical thriller. The latest expansion, Endwalker, brings a satisfying conclusion to the game’s now 8+ year storyline, returning some familiar faces, settling old scores, and of course saving the world from the greatest calamity yet.
            Don’t be scared away by the fact that it’s online. Despite being an MMO, Square-Enix has streamlined things so much that, if you don’t want to, you really don’t have to play with other people. Story missions are intended to be tackled solo, and even instanced dungeons now have an option for you to enter with computer-controlled party members instead of forcing you into a group with strangers. Of course, it’s also a fully-fleshed MMO with end-game raiding that ranges from totally accessible to maddeningly punishing.</p>

            <p>It’s hard to define Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Recreating the opening hours of the original RPG as a full-blown action game in downright gorgeous style, it isn’t afraid to play with those iconic characters and the story around them in ways that often feel more like a sequel than a remake. But no matter what path this seemingly new series continues blaze, and however you want to label FF7R, one thing is for sure: whatever this is absolutely rules.

                Its combat is some of the best around, the city of Midgar is dense and stunning, and its characters are lovable recreations of the low-poly people fans fell in love with years ago. It may not be the faithful reimagining some were hoping for, but it’s also loaded with enough nostalgia that it’s hard to be too mad about that. FF7R not only brought the original back to life, it set the stage for a whole new adventure that’s just as exciting.

          <img src="re4-blogroll-1679022261876-1711035889347.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Simultaneously one of the newest games on this list and also the oldest, the 2023 remake of 2005’s Resident Evil 4 took everything that made the original a standout action-horror classic and modernized it to thrill present-day gamers just as much as it had those who always saw it through rose-tinted glasses. Rebuilt from the ground up, it builds tension with high-intensity combat against a ferocious cast of creatures and brings the Resident Evil world to life with rich detail as the story rapidly guides you through a series of unwaveringly impressive action sequences. There’ve been many games that have attempted to evoke RE4’s style over the years, but none that nailed it quite as well as this.</p>

        <h1>18. God of War</h1>
        <div>
            <img src="god-of-war-1711035889349.jpg" alt="">
            <p>God of War made a huge impact when it launched as a PlayStation exclusive in 2018, even taking home IGN’s Game of the Year award. But its greatness didn’t hinge on its platform, and its arrival on Steam in early 2022 opened it up to a whole new audience – one that should absolutely take the opportunity to play it if they haven’t before.
            This reinvention of the classic series is truly fantastic, all the way from its excellent and challenging combat to the incredibly touching story that weaves it together. It’s gorgeously presented and thorough in its detail, taking advantage of its roots while innovating on them in a way that feels fresh again. It’s a true standout from the last decade, and it absolutely deserves to be counted amongst other PC greats now that it’s here.</p>

            <h1>17. Doom (2016)</h1>
            <div>
              <img src="doom-1711035889347.jpg" alt="">
              <p>One of the greatest reimaginings of a classic game ever made, the 2016 reboot of Doom held nothing back as it launched us face-first into a horde of space demons and invited us to rip and tear them to shreds, then feast upon the glowing bits that popped out so that we could do it again and again. While the sequel, Doom Eternal, arguably improved on the combat by making it even more technical, for us nothing beats the relative simplicity of the satisfying slug-fests of Doom.
             This wildly aggressive style of single-player action felt like it broke first-person shooters out of a rut – the year before had seen Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Battlefield Hardline, Halo 5: Guardians, and Star Wars Battlefront, all of which focused on multiplayer and didn’t age especially well. Doom, however, has become even easier to appreciate with how well it holds up, and it’s hard not to notice its influence in the games that’ve come along since.</p>

                <p>Seeing as it collects all of the deviously designed scenarios from Io Interactive’s recent Hitman trilogy under one banner, Hitman: World of Assassination is too good to pass up. With all of the rich, rewarding, and highly replayable sandboxes at your fingertips, there’s virtually no end to the cold-blooded and often hilarious trouble you can cause as Agent 47. Tracking down a multitude of surprising and imaginative assassination opportunities requires examining every nook and cranny, carefully observing every NPC’s behavior, and making full use of every piece of gear and weapon – and getting away with a perfect hit with no one even knowing you were there is one of gaming’s biggest and most satisfying thrills.</p>

                <img src="nier-1711035889348.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Technical problems with the PC version kept Nier Automata off of this list in the past, but with Steam’s user reviews now giving a “Very positive” all-clear its popularity with the IGN staff has powered it into a strong position. This action-RPG opus delivers a ridiculously entertaining journey full of awesome ideas that is equal parts strange and beautiful. There are few games like it in the way that it bounces between genres and styles with aplomb, offering a roller coaster of different gameplay opportunities, wrapped up in a fascinating futuristic dystopia story with many possible endings, encouraging us to poke into every corner of its engrossing world. Couple that with frenzied combat and an unforgettable soundtrack, and it’s more than worth checking out if you missed it.</p>

           <h1>14. Half-Life: Alyx </h1>
           <div>
             <img src="alyx-1711035889348.jpg" alt="">
             <p>Valve’s first Half-Life game in 13 years reminded us of the signature innovation that’s made this series so special, and why its return was so anticipated. Just as the first Half-Life proved you could tell a compelling story in a first-person game without taking control of the camera away, and Half-Life 2 pioneered physics-based puzzles and combat, Half-Life: Alyx set a new standard for polish in virtual reality shooters and is a truly unique experience. It's so impressive, in fact, that we believe fully justifies investing in a VR headset for your PC if you haven't already (especially now that a Meta Quest 2 can be had for less than $300 and connects to your PC wirelessly via Air Link).

                Alyx's full-length campaign pulls out all the stops for an amazing and horrifying battle against aliens and zombies where the simple act of reloading your weapon becomes a desperate life-or-death struggle as headcrabs leap toward your actual face. Other VR games have great shooting, but even more than a year later nothing has yet matched Valve's level of detail. Clever three-dimensional puzzles and excellent and often funny performances from its cast break up the action, and it's all capped off with a fantastic ending that made the decade-plus we had to wait for the third coming of Half-Life almost feel worth it.</p>

                <p>The Stanley Parable was a triumph when it first came out back in 2013, pointedly messing with player expectations and tried-and-true video game tropes through hilariously written and read narration. Its Ultra Deluxe version from 2022 provides a nice visual refresh on the surface, but its greatest trick is how it hides an entire sequel’s worth of new content just below. Instead of poking fun at games as a whole, it allows its gags to stay impressively relevant by setting its sights on the unsettling rise of DLC since the original. The result is a definitive version of a fantastic game for newcomers and what is essentially a brand new one for returning fans, turning the incredibly difficult task of following up The Stanley Parable with pretty much anything at all into one that feels effortlessly clever.</p>
